An overengineered application made with overkill architecture to try multi container AWS builds, Docker, docker-compose, and Travis CI forming a CI/CD pipeline. 

The Application itself is a simple front-end, which has the feature to recieve input (an index -number-) and return in the UI the corresponding Fibonacci number. 

It works saving this index and showing which numbers the app has seen, and also saves the results in a relational DB.
